Scripts for Kerbal Space Program mod kOS

Flightplans correspond to ship names.

SR1 is for a suborbital rocket headed straight up to collect science and parachute down.

ASAT is for an automated orbiter, it requires that you have SAS via pilot or probe, and support for maneuver nodes (flight planning)

Once in space, the script will automatically warp to and execute maneuver nodes when you turn sas off.  It will turn sas on when it's done so you can add more nodes.
